= Usage

Two steps. First set how many threads we want to use. Second use for or map method iterate an array.

require 'parallel'

Parallel.config(:thread => 3)		# there will create 3 threads when we iterate an array.
Parallel.config(:thread => :core)	# how many threads will be created is dependents on cpu cores.

Parallel.for(array) do |item|
  # some expensive calculation
end
# Parallel.for will return an array that pass into it.
You can also use each method.

ret = Parallel.map([1, 2, 3]) do |item|
  item + 1
end
# ret => [2, 3, 4]

= Note
Parallel for and map method is not thread safe. You should make sure each iteration will not change any global data, except you lock it first.
